#My notes
Game Ideas:

isInCheck: Make piece of each type and see if there is a move 
that takes an enemy piece of the same type
Make moves of enemy pieces and see if any take the king

makeMove: Requires validMoves to be implemented

isInCheckmate: Probably best to implement  Check and then see if there are any validMoves

isInStalemate: stalemate only - no validMoves

validMoves: What makes a move invalid? No piece there, implemented. 
Also not valid if it puts the king in check
